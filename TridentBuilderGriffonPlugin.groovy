    String description = '''
Brings the [TridentBuilder][1] libraries (based on [Trident 6.2][2]) into your Griffon application.

Usage
----
Trident nodes are added by default to the root builder without a prefix, which means you can call them directly.
Refer to the [builder's][1] page to known what nodes are available.
